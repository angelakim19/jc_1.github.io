        to the dearest love of my life,</p>
      
        <p class="ty2">i hope this letter finds you smiling. happy first month my dearest carl. anyway, I hope your day went well, and you're doing great. you know how much i am thankful to have you. how happy i am because i met and experienced how to be loved by the amazing and loving guy in the world. </p>

        <p class="ty3">we both know that this first month that we have is just the start of many problems, hapinness, and countless struglles we will face together. i know lately we've been struglling to handle and adjust in our relationship. you've seen some parts of me that's unlovable, and i hope and pray that even though you still see that part of me or even much worse than that, you'll find a reason to stay, to still choose to love and understand me, and to always choose to fix things rather than ending what we have.</p>

        <p class="ty4">love, thank you and i'm sorry, i know i am really a lot to handle most of the time but you still manage to do it. i can't promise that we will never argue again, but one thing is for sure is that when situations become difficult, i won't easily leave and i will always go back to the reason why i said yes to you, and why i love you in the first place. happy first month baby, looking forward to the comming months,and years with you. i love you so much!</p>
